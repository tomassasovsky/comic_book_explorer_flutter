Generated by the [Very Good CLI][very_good_cli_link] ðŸ¤–

A Flutter App that consumes the restful API of Comic Vine, the largest comic database online.

---

## Getting Started ðŸš€

First, you're gonna need to generate an API Key for the Comic Vine API. You can get it from [here](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/)
After that, you're gonna want to place it in the launch files. Keep in mind:

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Comic Book Explorer works on iOS, Android, Web, and Windows._

## Known issues
 - CORS policies are not implemented in the Comic Vine RestAPI, causing the requests to not work on Flutter Web. A workaround would be to use a so called `CORS ANYWHERE PROXY` - one implementation of this can be found [here](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com). 

## Running Tests ðŸ§ª

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```
